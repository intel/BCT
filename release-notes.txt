   value of comboboxes

Release 3.0.2
=============

* This is the initial release for BCT

===============================================================================
3.  INSTALLATION INFORMATION
===============================================================================
Linux builds now include a new install.sh file. This script will copy BCT to
~/.local and add BCT to the list of applications registered with the desktop.
This is useful for single-user home directory installations.

The visual appearance of BCT on Red Hat/Fedora/Rocky systems can be improved
by installing the following package:

sudo dnf install adwaita-gtk2-theme

Otherwise, please refer the Intel(R) Binary Configuration Tool User's Guide for
the installation instructions and for help on how to use the tool.

===============================================================================
4. LIMITATIONS
===============================================================================
 - The Windows version of BCT will not print messages to the console. This only
   affects Windows users who want to run BCT from the command line and not use
   the GUI. BCT will read the command line arguments correctly and do things
   such as generate an ABSF from a BSF, patch, and rebase a binary, but it will
   not print any messages to the console. This is a limitation from the tool we
   use to generate a Windows executable.

===============================================================================
5. KNOWN ISSUES
===============================================================================
 - Rebase.log file is not being generated.
